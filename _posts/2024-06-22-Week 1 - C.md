## Hello, World!


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

>     hello, world

## Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
It is defined once and can be called multiple times within a program.
> <span class="code"><span class="green">return_type</span> function_name(<span class="green">parameter_list</span></span>)  
> {  
>   
> }
### Parts of a Function

#### Return Type : <span class="green"><span class="code">return_type</span></span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return type specifies the data type that is returned by this function.  

#### Function Name : <span class="code"><span class="white">function_name</span></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a unique identifier that follows the same naming conventions as variable names.

#### Parameter List : <span class="code"><span class="green">parameter_list</span></span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of inputs, separated by commas, that the function takes.

#### Function Body : <span class="code">{ }</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function body is enclosed in the two curly braces that follow the function.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the code that is executed when the function is called.

### Function Prototypes
A function prototype provides the compiler with information about the function, typically before it is defined.  
An undeclared function error occurs when a function is called before it is defined or declared.
> <span class="code"><span class="green">return_type</span> function_name(<span class="green">parameter_list</span>);</span>

## Variables

Variables are used to store data which can be manipulated by the program.
> <span class="code"><span class="green">type</span> variable_name;</span>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green"><span class="code">type</span></span> specifies the data type that is stored within the variable, which is then given a name, in this case " <span class="code">variable_name</span> ".

### Variable Scope

Scope refers to where, in a program, a variable can be accessed.  

#### Types of Variable Scope
1. Local Scope

2. Global Scope

#### Local Scope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of a variable is local to the function or block it is declared within.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that that variable is only accesible within that function or block.

#### Global Scope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variable that is declared outside of any function has global scope.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variable can be accessed anywhere inside a program.

### Constants

Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed.  
They are declared using the <span class="code">'const'</span> keyword.

```c
const int MAX_VALUE = 100;
```
In this example, the integer <span class="code box">MAX_VALUE</span> is declared as a constant with a value of 100.

## Conditionals

Conditionals are used to perform actions based on certain conditions.  

### <span class="code">'if'</span>

An if statement executes a block of code if a condtion is true.

```c
if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed if condition is true.
}
```
### <span class="code">'if-else'</span>

An if-else statement executes a block of code if a condition is true, or a different block of code if false.

```c
if (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed if condtion is true.
}
else
{
    // Code to be executed if condition is false.
}
```

### <span class="code">'else-if'</span>

An else-if statement, following if statements, checks another condition and executes a block of code if it is true.

```c
if (condition1)
{
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true.
}
else if (condition2)
{
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true.
}
...
else if (condition99)
{
    // Code to be executed if condition99 is true.
}
else
{
    // Code to be executed if all conditions are false.
}
```

### Nesting

If statments can be nested within themselves.
Here is an example:

```c
if (condition1)
{
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true.

    if (condition2)
    {
        // Code to be executed if condition2 is true.
    }
}
```
*Note: Nested if statements can function similarly in logic to AND operators, but different blocks of code can be executed before* <span class="code box">condition2</span> *is checked, if* <span class="code box">condition1</span> *is true.*

### <span class="code">'switch'</span>

A switch statement tests a variable for equality against a list of values.

```c
switch (expression) 
{
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if expression equals value1
        break;

    case value2:
        // Code to be executed if expression equals value2
        break;

    ...

    case value99:
        // Code to be executed if expression equals value99

    default:
        // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
```

Example:

```c
int day = 4;
switch (day) 
{
    case 1:
        printf("Monday\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday\n");
        break;
    case 4:
        printf("Thursday\n");
        break;
    case 5:
        printf("Friday\n");
        break;
    case 6:
        printf("Saturday\n");
        break;
    case 7:
        printf("Sunday\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid day\n");
}
```
In this example, we check if the variable <span class="code box">day</span> is equal to any values of the cases listed.  

*Note: Case labels must be constant.*

## Loops

Loops are used in order to perform and repeat a set of tasks.

### Types of Loops

1. <span class="code">for</span>

2. <span class="code">while</span>

3. <span class="code">do-while</span>

#### <span class="code">'for'</span> Loops

<span class="code">'for'</span> loops are used when the number of iterations are known beforehand.

```c
for(initialization; condition; increment)
{
    // Code to be executed.
}
```
#### Components of <span class="code">'for'</span> loops:
1. <span class="code">'initialization'</span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part initializes the control variable for a loop, and is executed only once.

```c
for (int i = 0;             // Creating the variable 'i', and setting it to 0.
```
2. <span class="code">'condition'</span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition is an expression that is evaluated at the *beginning* of every loop. If the condition is true, the loop body executes. If false, the loop terminated.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 1       // Evaluate the expression 'i < 1' at the start of every iteration.
                            // If true, execute the body of the loop.
                            // If false, terminate the loop.
```
3. <span class="code">'increment'</span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increment (or decrement) is executed after each iteration of the loop body. It typically updates the loop's control variable.
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++) // Add 1 to 'i' after every loop.
{

}
```
#### <span class="code">'while'</span> Loops

<span class="code">'while'</span> loops are used when the number of iterations are unknown, and depends on a condition.
```c
while(condition)
{
    // Code to be executed.
}
```
A condition is evaluated at the start of every loop. If true, the body of the loop is executed. If false, the loop terminates.

For example:
```c
int x = 0;

while (x < 3)
{
    printf('%i', x);
    x++
}
```
This <span class="code">'while'</span> loop:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Evaluates the condition <span class="box code">x < 3</span>.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Prints the value of x.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Adds 1 to x.  

This process then repeats until x is greater than or equal to 3.

#### <span class="code">'do-while'</span> Loops

These <span class="code">'do-while'</span> loops are similar to <span class="code">'while'</span> loops, but the condition is evaluated *after* the loop has executed.  
This ensures that the loop has executed at least once.
```c
do
{
    // Code to be executed.

} while (condition);
```
### Loop Control Statements

1. <span class="code">'break'</span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exits the loop immediately.
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        break;  // Exit the loop when 'i' equals 5.
    }
}
```
2. <span class="code">'continue'</span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
    {
        if (i == 5) 
        {
            continue; // Skip the iteration when 'i' equals 5
        }
        printf("i = %d\n", i);
    }
```
*Note: In this example, we skip the iteration when <span class="box code">i == 5</span>, but we still increment <span class="code">i</span> by 1 as denoted by <span class="box code">i++</span> in the loop's components.*  

3. <span class="code">'goto'</span>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers control to a labeled statement.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally discouraged to use this.
```c
int main(void) 
{
    int i = 0;
    
    loop_start:             // Labeled statement "loop_start"
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    i++;
    if (i < 5) 
    {
        goto loop_start;    // Transfers control to "loop_start"
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the code executes and while <span class="box code">x < 5</span>, we will go to the label <span class="code box">loop_start</span>.

### Additional Loop Examples

#### Nested <span class="code">'for'</span> Loops

```c
int count;

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
    {
        count++
        print("Count: %i", count);
    }
}
```
The <span class="code">'for'</span> loops in this example will print the value of <span class="code">i</span>, 100 times.  
*For every iteration of a total of 10 iterations of the outer loop, the inner loop will execute 10 times.*

#### Multiple Initialization and Increment Statements

```c
for (int i = 0, j = 10; i < 10 && j > 0; i++, j--)
{
    // Code to be executed.
}
```
The <span class="code">'for'</span> loop in this example does the following:  
- initializes two variables: <span class="code">i</span> and <span class="code">j</span>, and assigns them a value of 1 and 10, respectively.  

- evaluates the expression, <span class="code box">i < 10 && j > 0</span>, which is only true if both <span class="code">i</span> is less than 10, and <span class="code">j</span> is greater than 0.  

- increments <span class="code">i</span> by 1, and decrements <span class="code">j</span> by 1 after every iteration.

#### Infinite Loops

Loops execute their body of code when their condition is true.  
If we set the condition to always be true, the body of code will be looped and executed infinitely.  
The following examples will loop a body of code, infinitely :

##### Using <span class="code">'for'</span> Loops

```c
for(;;)
{
    // Code to be executed.
}
```
##### Using 'while' Loops

```c
while(1)
{
    // Code to be executed.
}
```
##### Using 'do-while' Loops

```c
do
{

} while (1);
```

## Abstraction

Abstraction in programming refers to the process of defining and using simple, high-level interfaces for complex, underlying code.  
This may involve creating functions, data structures, or objects that encapsulate specific behaviors or data.*

> When you encapsulate code into reusable blocks (such as functions, classes, or modules), you create an interface that other parts of the program can use without needing to know how the underlying code works.

*When you encapsulate code, you are separating the "what" from the "how":*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What: The functionality provided (e.g., adding two numbers).*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*How: The specific implementation details of how that functionality is achieved (e.g., the code inside the add function).*

### Functions and Abstraction

Functions encapsulate code into reusable blocks that perform specific tasks.  

This hides the details of the implementation from the rest of the program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int, int);

int main()
{
    int result = add(5, 3);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) 
{
    return a + b;
}
```
In this code, the function <span class="code box">add</span> is an example of abstraction.

The function <span class="code box">add</span> is "hidden" from our <span class="code box">main</span> function.  
As in, <span class="code box">main</span> still knows *what* the function <span class="code box">add</span> provides,  
but does not know *how* <span class="code box">add</span> provides it.

#### Example without Abstraction
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 5, b = 3;
    int result = a + b; // Direct implementation
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the code to add two numbers is written directly into <span class="code box">main</span> as opposed to the previous example, where it was written in a separate function <span class="code box">add</span> .

Any changes to this logic would require modifications to the <span class="code box">main</span> function, and this addition logic cannot be reused easily.

### Typedef and Data Structures and Abstraction

Data structures group related variables together into a single data type, simplying the process of managing multiple variables.

```c
typedef struct {
    char *name;
    int age;
} person;
```
In this example, a new data type is created <span class="code box">person</span>. This data type holds two different data members: <span class="code box">name</span>, which points to a string, and <span class="code box">age</span>, which is an integer. We can then create new variables of this new data type and assign values to its members.

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Create a variable of type 'person'
    person p1; 

    // Assign values to its members.
    p1.name = "John";
    p1.age = "30";
}
```

### Header Files and Abstraction

Header files are **separate** files which include the implementation of functions, the declaration of functions.

<span class="code">math_functions.h</span>

```c
// Function declarations
int add(int x, int y);
int subtract(int x, int y);
```

<span class="code">math_functions.c</span>

```c
#include "math_functions.h"

// Function definitions
int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int subtract(int a, int b)
{
    return a - b;
}
```
<span class="code">main.c</span>

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "math_functions.h"

int main(void)
{
    int sum = add(5, 3);
    int diff = subtract(5, 3);

    printf("Sum: %i", sum);
    printf("Difference: %i", difference);
}
```
